# HomographyDemo

I've put a left image and a right image in the folder Rot.
I've picked four corresponding points in each image (see Points folder).
Then I've applied homogrophies on the two images so that they meet in the middle.
This creates a sort of cinematic transformation of the images from left to right.

To test, executre the script `rotation.m`.

The output will populate the folder output.
Take a look at Rotation.gif which I've created with the output.
